## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for After Tax Return on Equity (ROE) using key financial metrics. This analysis will focus on understanding how various financial indicators, including Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Additional Income/Expense Items, Capital Expenditures, Capital Surplus, and Cash Ratio, influence ROE for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

### Data Preprocessing

- Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies within the dataset.
- Ensured uniformity across different companies and time periods by standardizing metrics.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted EDA to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns within the data.
- Created visualizations to illustrate the relationships between financial metrics and ROE, highlighting potential drivers of performance.

### Feature Selection

- #### Tree-Based Feature Importance
Utilized tree-based models to assess the correlation between various features and target variable.
- #### Linear Regression for Non-Linearity
Applied linear regression to capture non-linear relationships among the features.

#### Selected Features
