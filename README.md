## Project Overview

The goal of our project is to develop a predictive model that forecasts whether the closing price of an S&P 500 stock will increase or decrease on the next trading day based on opening price, highest price, lowest price, adjusted close price, and trading volume.

### Potential Users of the Predictive Model

## Data Description

We are using stock prices dataset from [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse?resource=download&select=prices-split-adjusted.csv)
The dataset covers the period from 2010 to the end of 2016 and includes stock data for 501 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. It consists of 851,264 individual data points, each representing daily stock market information for a specific company.

Key features used for prediction include:

- Opening Price
- Highest Price
- Lowest Price
- Adjusted Close Price
- Trading Volume

The dataset includes adjustments for 140 stock splits, recorded in the file `prices-split-adjusted.csv`. Past prices are retroactively adjusted to match the current scale of the stock price after all the splits during the 2010â€“2016 period. This ensures that the historical prices are comparable to today's prices, making it easier to analyze the stock's performance over time.

### Required Libraries

**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
**Numpy:** For numerical operations and handling arrays.
**Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
**Matplotlib.pyplot:** For creating visualizations like charts and plots.
**Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization, providing an interface for creating complex visualizations easily.
**Shap:** For model explainability, to analyze how individual features contribute to model predictions.

### Data Preprocessing

- Target variable is created to predict if the next day's closing price will be higher (1) or lower (0) than the current day's closing price.
- Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies within the dataset.
- Created new features daily_return and volatility to enhance the predictive model.
- Applied One Hot Encoding to encode the categorical column.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Plotted histograms to visualize the distribution and identify patterns, skewness, or outliers in the data.
- Computed the correlation matrix for selected numerical features and the target variable.
- Visualized the correlations using a heatmap to understand relationships between features and the target.
